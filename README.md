# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a map using GeoJSON to present data on earthquakes. The challenge for this included adding tectonic plate and earthquakes that were greater than 4.5 magnitude as layers to the map as well as a few additional graphical features. To do this, HTML and JavaScript languages were used as well as CSS. Within JavaScript, d3, Leaflet, and API calls were used to complete the project. 

## Results
The result of this project is a fully functional map with different visual options (satellite, street, and dark) and three options to examine of the map, earthquakes complete with magnitide and location pop-ups, tectonic plate layer, and earthquakes greater than 4.5 magnitude with magnitude and location pop-ups.
